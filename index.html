<h2>Written Questions</h2>

<h3>D3 Questions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        My dashboard addresses the question by...
        <ol>
            <li>
                I show all genres in a treemap. The tooltip pops up to show the name of the genre with the count.
                I would like to have been able to split them between "Movie" and "TV Show",
                but I could not figure out how to nest the data in order to do that.
                Although, this does show the number of titles per genre (and gives a nice size comparison).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I show a boxplot of runtime per year. Year is selectable in the text field.
                This may not allow easy comparisons, but displaying all years would be too much information to show.
                A boxplot shows more information than only the mean,
                but since I had to include the mean, it is displayed on mouse hover.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I show each director and actor as nodes in a graph. A film including both is represented by an edge.
                Showing the entire dataset makes the webpage unusable,
                but it is difficult to show a graph that large and disconnected.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's super easy to make animated visualizations.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can make way more kinds of visualization in d3 than you can in pandas.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's wonderful to be able to have d3 update your charts as the data comes in.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you don't need animations, it's so much faster to just to make static charts in pandas.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript can be kind of slow and processing data in the way we do (on-the-fly).
                It might lead to some serious performance issues for trying to visualizations for display large
                datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
                I've learned from this assignment that it's incredibly time-consuming to debug JavaScript.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Accessible Data Visualization</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Whenever possible, I tried to use blue and orange, which are good colors to accommodate the colorblind community.
        It will be difficult for the blind to navigate the graph structure when all of the data is displayed.
        I'd like to know if the popup text is actually read by a screen-reader or not.

    </li>
    <li>
        The difficulty of using d3 kept me from making my dashboard more accessible.
        Further, I did not see a single example online of using alt text, so I have absolutely no idea how to do it.
        Also, I don't have a screen-reader, so I can't verify anything for the blind community.
        In addition, the submission deadline forces us to focus on having a minimally-functioning page
        before we focus on accommodating others,
        which I'm sure is a point of this assignment since this is typical in industry.
