    <li>
        My dashboard addresses the question by...
    </li>
    <li>
        List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's super easy to make animated visualizations.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can make way more kinds of visualization in d3 than you can in pandas.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's wonderful to be able to have d3 update your charts as the data comes in.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you don't need animations, it's so much faster to just to make static charts in pandas.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript can be kind of slow and processing data in the way we do (on-the-fly).
                It might lead to some serious performance issues for trying to visualizations for display large
                datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
                I've learned from this assignment that it's incredibly time-consuming to debug JavaScript.
