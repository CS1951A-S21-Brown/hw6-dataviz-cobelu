Lastly, we want to learn about the cast and directors.
You have two choices here:
1) the top director + actor pairs by number of movies made
2) a flow chart where each actor is a node, and a link refers to a movie they both acted in
(just the connection, no need to specify number of movies made together or which movies those are)
